		<h2>Seawater color</h2>
		<p>Please tell me, what color is seawater?</p>
		<p>The color of seawater varies depending on location and depth, but is typically described as blue or green-blue. This is because seawater absorbs longer wavelength colors such as red, orange, and yellow, and reflects blue or green-blue wavelengths, resulting in the color that we see.</p>

		<h2>Sky color</h2>
		<p>Why is the sky blue in color?</p>
		<p>The color of the sky is also caused by light scattering. In the atmosphere, air molecules scatter sunlight, breaking it up into its various colors. Blue light waves are shorter and are more easily scattered than other colors, so we see the sky as blue. During sunset, the position of the sun is lower, so sunlight must travel through more atmosphere to reach the surface, causing most of the blue light to be scattered, leaving only orange and red light to reach the surface. This is why we see the sky turn orange or red during sunset.</p>
